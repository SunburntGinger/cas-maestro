CAS Maestro allows you to configure your centralized authentication service, CAS, for an integrated log in with WordPress. LDAP is optional.

== Description ==

If you have a CAS service and you want to authenticate your users in WordPress with the same credentials, you can use this plugin to get the job done.

The users that attempt to start their sessions in WordPress, will be redirected to the CAS single sign-on page, where their sessions starts. If the user data is valid, they are redirected back to WordPress. If the credentials already exist in your WordPress the user will be authenticated. Otherwise, if the user was pre-registered in the configuration page, the user will be created.

CAS Maestro can also connect to a LDAP server to access personal data to be used in user profile.

Features included:

* Full integration with the WordPress authentication system
* One of the most secure CAS plugins for WordPress
* Possibility to pre-register some known users, with the desired role
* LDAP integration for user data fill, such as name and e-mail 
* Validation mechanisms to avoid getting blocked in case of misconfiguration
* Mail notification for pre-registered users
* Network activation allowed (todo: network panel for configuration)

== Installation ==

1. Install Cas Maestro either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (`/wp-content/plugins/`) 
2. Activation can be made in 'Plugins' menu
3. Configure carefully Cas Maestro through plugin's page

**ATTENTION** If for some reason you are unable to access the administrator panel, you can disable the CAS Maestro behavior by adding the code line define('WPCAS_BYPASS',true); to `wp-config.php` file. That way you can configure CAS Maestro before revert the previous instruction.

**Did you know...** If you leave empty fields in CAS Maestro configuration, the plugin will ask you to fill fields before final activation. Therefore you can use WordPress login system before the configuration conclusion.
